1. Is array passed by value or reference to a function. Justify your answer with an example.

arrays are passed by reference

for example,


  let func=(arr)=>{
    arr[2]=7;
  }

  let arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
  func(arr)  
  console.log(arr)  // prints [1,2,7,4,5]

2. Write a Javascript function to clone an array without using loops.
  

  let a=[1,2,3,4,5]
let b=a.slice(0,a.length)
console.log(b)





3. Breifly explain the below Array methods with examples
shift, unshift, slice, splice, pop"


    shift() is builtin function that deletes elements at beginning of array
    unshift() is builtin function that adds elements at beginning of array
    slice() is builtin function that returns a copy of elements ina an array
    splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements 
    pop() method deletes the last element in an array
